#Not so basic CAD
not so basic cad engineering notebook submission

in not so basic CAD we did sweeps and lofts.  This was the first time I used
sweep feature.You use a revolve feature which is something that makes it so 
that something is circular.Also there are different types of arcs used
in this. Also this is the first time that I used trim entities.
Also this used relations like horizontal. This was also new.Swept boss base
was also new. Sweep feature makes it so that something follows a line 
that is wide or thicker. I had some trouble with this. It would not follow 
the correct path. What i did to fix this is redo it and make sure that 
everything was selected right. Trim entities makes it so that you can get
rid of a part of something. 

There was also loft features. In this you create new planes. On each one 
you can put something different.Use lofted boss/base. Click one place on all
of them and it will connect them.You can also twist something using flex.
You choose two points and a then select a vertex to twist around them.
I struggled with the flex thing i couldnt get the 
bend right.
Making sure to choose the right point was very important for both sweeps and
lofts or they wouldn't do the thing tey were supposed to right.
Making sure I chose the right point fixed the problems I had.
